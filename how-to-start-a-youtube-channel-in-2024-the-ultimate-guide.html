                <article>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Step 1: Find Your Niche and Target Audience</h3>
                            <p>Before anything else, decide what your channel will be about. Choose a topic you're passionate and knowledgeable about. Is it gaming, cooking, tech reviews, education, or lifestyle vlogs? A clear niche helps you attract a dedicated audience.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Step 2: Create a Google Account</h3>
                            <p>Your YouTube channel is linked to a Google Account. If you have one already (like a Gmail address), you can use it. If not, create a new one. It's often recommended to create a separate Google Account specifically for your YouTube brand.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Step 3: Set Up Your YouTube Brand Account</h3>
                            <p>Go to YouTube.com, click your profile icon in the top right, and select 'Create a channel.' You'll be prompted to create a 'Brand Account,' which is recommended as it allows multiple managers and a custom name different from your personal Google Account name.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Step 4: Brand Your Channel</h3>
                            <p>First impressions matter. Navigate to the 'Customize channel' button in YouTube Studio. You'll need:
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Profile Picture:</strong> A clear, high-resolution photo of you or a logo (800x800 pixels recommended).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Banner Art:</strong> The large image at the top of your channel (2560x1440 pixels recommended). This is prime real estate to show what your channel is about.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Video Watermark:</strong> A small icon that appears on all your videos. Use your logo or a 'subscribe' button.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Step 5: Plan and Create Your First Video</h3>
                            <p>Don't just hit record. Plan your content. A simple script or an outline can make your video more concise and professional. Your first video could be a channel trailer introducing yourself and your content, or you can jump straight into your first topic.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Step 6: Upload and Optimize Your Video</h3>
                            <p>You're ready! Click the 'Create' button in YouTube Studio to upload. Optimization is key for discoverability:
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Compelling Title:</strong> Use keywords your audience would search for.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Detailed Description:</strong> Explain what the video is about, add links, and include keywords.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Tags:</strong> Add relevant tags to help YouTube's algorithm understand your content. Finding the right tags can be tough, but tools can help. For instance, an app like <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tube.boost.social.media" target="_blank">Tube Boost</a> is designed to help creators find trending keywords and optimize their videos for maximum reach.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Custom Thumbnail:</strong> Create an eye-catching thumbnail. This is arguably the most important factor for getting clicks.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
