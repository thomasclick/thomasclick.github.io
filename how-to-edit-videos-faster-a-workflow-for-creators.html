                    <h2>What is a Video Editing Workflow?</h2>
                    <p>A video editing workflow is a repeatable, step-by-step process you follow for every video project. It breaks down the entire edit into manageable phases, from file organization to final export. Instead of randomly jumping between color grading, cutting clips, and adding sound effects, a workflow ensures you complete tasks in a logical order, preventing rework and saving mental energy.</p>

                    <h2>The 7-Step Workflow to Edit Videos Faster</h2>
                    <p>Adopt this structured process to transform your editing speed and efficiency.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Step 1: Organize and Ingest</h3>
                            <p>Before you even open your editing software, organize your files. Create a main project folder with subfolders for <code>Video</code>, <code>Audio</code>, <code>Graphics</code>, <code>Music</code>, and <code>Project Files</code>. This prevents hunting for assets later. Import everything into your editing software and organize it into corresponding bins.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Step 2: The Assembly (Rough Cut)</h3>
                            <p>This is the 'fat trimming' phase. Go through all your primary footage (A-roll) and place the usable clips onto your timeline in chronological order. Don't worry about perfect timing, transitions, or B-roll yet. The goal is simply to build the story's skeleton.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Step 3: The Fine Cut & B-Roll</h3>
                            <p>Refine the timing of your assembly cut. Tighten up the edits, remove awkward pauses, and ensure the pacing feels right. Now, layer in your B-roll footage, cutaways, and supplementary clips to visually support the story and hide jump cuts.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Step 4: Audio and Sound Design</h3>
                            <p>Good audio is non-negotiable. Level your dialogue, remove background noise, and mix in music and sound effects (SFX). A common mistake is leaving audio until the end. Addressing it now ensures your visual edits are timed correctly with audio cues.</p>
                        </li>
                         <li>
                            <h3>Step 5: Color Correction and Grading</h3>
                            <p>With the edit locked, it's time for color. First, perform <strong>color correction</strong> to fix exposure and white balance issues, ensuring all clips look consistent. Then, apply <strong>color grading</strong> to create a specific mood or style (e.g., cinematic, vintage, vibrant).</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Step 6: Graphics, Titles, and Effects</h3>
                            <p>Add your lower thirds, titles, end screens, and any visual effects. Doing this near the end prevents you from having to re-animate graphics if you change an underlying clip's timing.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Step 7: Final Review and Export</h3>
                            <p>Watch the entire video from start to finish one last time to catch any mistakes. Once you're satisfied, export the video using the correct settings for your target platform (YouTube, Instagram, etc.).</p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
