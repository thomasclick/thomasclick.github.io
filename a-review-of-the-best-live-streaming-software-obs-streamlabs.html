            <h2>What is Live Streaming Software?</h2>
            <p>Live streaming software acts as the central hub for your broadcast. It captures your video (from a webcam or gameplay), audio (from a microphone), and other visual elements (like overlays, alerts, and images), encodes them into a single video format, and sends it to a platform like YouTube. Without it, you wouldn't be able to create the professional, multi-source broadcasts that viewers expect.</p>
