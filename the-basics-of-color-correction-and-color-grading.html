                    <h2>Introduction: From Raw Footage to Cinematic Masterpiece</h2>
                    <p>Have you ever wondered why professional films look so polished and visually stunning? The secret often lies in expert <strong>color correction and color grading</strong>. This crucial step in video post-production can transform flat, uninspired footage into a vibrant, cinematic experience that evokes emotion and tells a story.

                    <h2>Definition: Color Correction vs. Color Grading</h2>
                    <p>Though often used interchangeably, color correction and color grading are two distinct processes.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Color Correction:</strong> This is the technical, corrective process. The goal is to fix any color issues and ensure the footage looks natural and consistent. It's about making the video look the way the human eye would see it. Key tasks include adjusting white balance, exposure, contrast, and saturation to create a clean, standardized baseline.</li>
                        <li><strong>Color Grading:</strong> This is the creative, artistic process that comes after correction. Here, you apply a specific look or style to your video to create a mood, convey emotion, and enhance the narrative. This is where you develop your signature 'cinematic look,' using color to influence how the audience feels.</li>

                <section id='step-by-step'>
                    <h2>A Step-by-Step Guide to Basic Correction</h2>
                    <p>Before you can get creative, you need a solid foundation. Follow these steps in your video editing software (like DaVinci Resolve, Premiere Pro, or Final Cut Pro).</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Adjust Exposure:</strong> Ensure your shot is not too dark (underexposed) or too bright (overexposed). Use scopes like the Waveform monitor to guide you.</li>
                        <li><strong>Set White Balance:</strong> Correct any color casts to make the whites in your image appear pure white. This makes all other colors in the scene accurate.</li>
                        <li><strong>Fine-tune Contrast:</strong> Adjust the difference between the darkest and brightest parts of your image to add depth and dimension.</li>
                        <li><strong>Adjust Saturation:</strong> Control the intensity of the colors. A good starting point is a natural, true-to-life level of saturation.</li>
                    </ol>
