                    <h2>What Are Super Chat, Super Stickers, and Super Thanks?</h2>
                    <p>These three features, collectively known as 'Supers,' allow viewers to purchase special items to stand out and connect with you.</p>
                    <h3>Super Chat</h3>
                    <p>Super Chat is a feature for livestreams and Premieres. Viewers can purchase a highlighted message in the live chat feed. The message stays pinned for a certain amount of time, depending on how much the viewer paid, making it highly visible to you and everyone else in the stream.</p>
                    <h3>Super Stickers</h3>
                    <p>Similar to Super Chat, Super Stickers are purchased during livestreams and Premieres. Instead of a text message, viewers can buy animated stickers that pop up in the live chat, adding a fun and visual way to show support.</p>
                    <h3>Super Thanks</h3>
                    <p>Super Thanks allows viewers to show appreciation on your regular, uploaded videos (not just livestreams). A viewer can purchase a fun, one-time animation on the video page and post a colorful, distinct comment in the comments section to highlight their contribution.</p>
