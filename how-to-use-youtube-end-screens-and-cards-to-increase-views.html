But what happens when your video ends? Do viewers click away, or do you guide them to their next watch? This is where <strong>YouTube End Screens and Cards</strong> become your most powerful tools for increasing views, watch time, and subscribers. Mastering these features is a non-negotiable strategy for channel growth. By strategically promoting your other content, you create a seamless viewing experience that keeps your audience engaged. For creators serious about optimizing every aspect of their channel, using an analytics tool like <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tube.boost.social.media" target="_blank">Tube Boost</a> can provide the data needed to choose which videos to feature, maximizing your results.</p></section><section id="what-are-they"><h2>What Are YouTube End Screens and Cards?</h2><article><h3>YouTube End Screens</h3><p>An <strong>End Screen</strong> is a customizable screen that appears during the last 5-20 seconds of your video. You can use it to add clickable elements that promote other videos, playlists, your channel's subscribe button, or even external websites (for members of the YouTube Partner Program). It's your final, direct call-to-action to the viewer.</p></article><article><h3>YouTube Cards</h3><p><strong>Cards</strong> are interactive, pop-up notifications that you can place at specific timestamps within your video. They are less intrusive than end screens and can be used to promote a video, playlist, or channel. When a viewer clicks the small 'i' icon, the card expands to show the full information. They are perfect for providing contextually relevant links while the video is still playing.</p></article></section><section id="how-to-add-end-screens"><h2>Step-by-Step Guide: Adding YouTube End Screens</h2><ol><li><strong>Navigate to YouTube Studio:</strong> Log in to your YouTube account and go to the YouTube Studio.</li><li><strong>Select a Video:</strong> Click on 'Content' from the left-hand menu and choose the video you want to edit.</li><li><strong>Open the Editor:</strong> Click on the 'Editor' option from the left menu for that video.</li><li><strong>Add End Screen:</strong> Select 'End screen' from the editor timeline.
