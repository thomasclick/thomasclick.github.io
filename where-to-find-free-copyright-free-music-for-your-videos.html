                    <h2>What is Copyright-Free & Royalty-Free Music?</h2>
                    <p>Understanding the terminology is the first step to staying safe:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Copyright-Free Music:</strong> This term often refers to music in the <strong>Public Domain</strong>. The copyright has expired, been forfeited, or was never applicable, making it free for anyone to use without permission.</li>
                        <li><strong>Royalty-Free Music:</strong> This is a common misconception. It doesn't mean the music is free. It means you pay a one-time fee (or get it for free from certain sites) to acquire a license to use the music as many times as you want without paying additional royalties for each play.</li>
                        <li><strong>Creative Commons (CC) Music:</strong> This music is free to use, but you must follow the specific rules of its license. Most commonly, this involves giving attribution (credit) to the original artist. Always check the license type (e.g., CC BY, CC BY-SA).</li>
                    </ul>
